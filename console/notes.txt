Provisioners v User Data


There are 2 different ways to execute o a server using Terraform

1   Remote exec

    Type : shell, ansible, puppet, chef
    Unlimited length  : howvever with geraet flexibility comes greate disadvantages
    

2 User Data Scripts

D
  limited in size to 16 KB
  Does not have facility to run Ansible, Chef, Puppet   

A
  ASG
  Runs after resource deployed and works well with ASG  handling auto reload events
    - Remote Exec provisioners can not becuase they run only once when Terraform is running
  
  SECURITY
  User data requires only the AWS API  and no SSH keys therefor its more secure
    - Remote Exec does require opening SSH and WinRM  to access servers
      More complicated to manage these keys/ less secure 

  DEBUGGING
  User Data logs can be seen in EC2 Console   Actions - Instance Settings View/Change User Data
  
  Log : if you ssh onto the EC2 box : go to /var/log/cloud-init*.log
 
    - Provisioners can not
